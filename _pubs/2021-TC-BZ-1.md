### Abstract

The proposed herein is a scalable high-radix (i.e., 2^m) Montgomery Modular (MM) Multiplication circuit replacing the integer multiplications in each iteration of the Montgomery MM algorithm (related to the product of mm bits of the multiplier and the multiplicand) with carry-save compressions and completely eliminating costly multiplications. Furthermore, the proposed Montgomery MM decomposes the multiplicand itself using a radix of 2^w with wâ‰¥2m, thereby achieving a scalable design, which can deliver an issue latency of one cycle and a cycle (count) latency of O(N2/(wmp)) where pp denotes the number of available processing elements, each of which is designed to complete the above iteration by computing in part the product of ww bits of the multiplicand and mm bits of the multiplier. The area complexity of the proposed Montgomery MM is O(wmp), and thus, the Area-Latency-Product complexity is O(N^2).
